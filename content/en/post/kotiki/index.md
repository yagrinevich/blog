## Post about last week

1. On Monday, I studied English intensively, and also prepared for the intercollegiate dance competition.
2. On Tuesday I worked in a coffee shop on the Arbat, in the center of Moscow.
3. On Wednesday, I finally visited the university, where I wrote tests - math analysis and math logic.
4. On Thursday I visited an incredibly interesting programming couple.
5. On Friday, I finally wrote the Python entrance test and was admitted to the computer practicum.
