## Пост о прошедшей неделе

1. В понедельник я усиленно занималась английским, а так же готовилась к межвузовскуму конкурсу танцев.
2. Во вторник я работала в кофейне на Арбате, в центре Москвы.
3. В среду я наконец-то посетила университет, где написала контрольные работы-матанализ и матлогика. 
4. В четверг я посетила невероятно интересную пару по программированию.
5. В пятницу я наконец-то написала входное тестирование по Python и была допущена к компьютерному практикуму.
